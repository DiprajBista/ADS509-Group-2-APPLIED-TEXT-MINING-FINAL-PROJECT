The Company operates on a fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in January and designates its fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends (e.g., fiscal year 2019 refers to the Company’s fiscal year ending January 27, 2019).  The Compensation Committee has set the Performance Goals for fiscal year 2019 based upon the achievement of specified fiscal year 2019 revenue and has established threshold, base operating plan, and stretch operating plan levels.  An eligible participant’s variable cash compensation under the 2019 Plan will be based on the achievement by the Company of the Performance Goals.  Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant must remain an employee through the payment date under the 2019 Plan to be eligible to earn an award.

      "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.: On December 15, 2017, NVIDIA Corporation (the “Company”) established a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed $575 million. The notes will have maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue and rank at least equally with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds from the issuances of the notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company plans to use its revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for its borrowings under the program. One or more dealers for the program will be engaged to either purchase from the Company or arrange for the sale by the Company of the notes pursuant to the respective commercial paper dealer agreement entered into between the Company and each dealer. The dealer agreements contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. A copy of the form of dealer agreement used in the program is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the summary of the program herein is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the program as set forth in the dealer agreement. A national bank will act as agent under the program pursuant to the terms of an issuing and paying agent agreement. From time to time, the dealers and certain of their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, banking and other financial advisory services to the Company and its affiliates for which the dealers have received or will receive customary fees and expenses. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.

      "Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.: On November 6, 2017, NVIDIA Land Development, LLC, or NVIDIA Land, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, exercised its option under a Real Property Lease with Wachovia Service Corporation to terminate a Ground Lease and a Real Property Lease and purchase real property containing the Company’s new Santa Clara campus building at the intersection of Walsh Avenue and San Tomas Expressway in Santa Clara, California, or the Property, from Wachovia for approximately $350 million. On June 19, 2015, NVIDIA Land entered into the Ground Lease, Real Property Lease, Participation Agreement, Agency Agreement and related documents with Wachovia; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; and a syndicate of other institutions, or collectively, the Participants, for the construction and lease of the Company’s new Santa Clara campus building. As part of the transaction, NVIDIA Land ground leased to Wachovia the Property and, in connection with construction of the Company’s new Santa Clara campus building, Wachovia leased the Property back to NVIDIA Land. Construction of the Company’s new Santa Clara campus building was substantially completed on October 31, 2017. The purchase price approximates the sum of: repayment of the Participants’ investment in the Property, capitalized interest accrued during the construction period, any accrued but unpaid rent under the Real Property Lease, and the fees and expenses of the Participants incurred in connection with the purchase. Upon completing the purchase, the agreements referenced above and related documents will be terminated and NVIDIA Land will hold all right, title and interest in the Property, free and clear of any secured financing. NVIDIA Land has obtained a waiver from a majority of the Participants of the requirement to provide 90 days advance notice to exercise the purchase option. NVIDIA expects to complete the purchase and take title to the Property during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.: Adoption of Fiscal Year 2018 Variable Compensation Plan On March 7, 2017, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors adopted the Variable Compensation Plan for Fiscal Year 2018, or the 2018 Plan, which provides eligible executive officers the opportunity to earn a variable cash payment based on the level of achievement by us of certain corporate performance goals, or the Performance Goals, during our fiscal year 2018. We operate on a fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in January. We designate our fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends (e.g., fiscal year 2018 refers to our fiscal year ending January 28, 2018).  The Compensation Committee has set the Performance Goals for fiscal year 2018 based upon the achievement of specified fiscal year 2018 revenue and has established threshold, base operating plan and stretch operating plan levels.  An eligible participant’s variable cash compensation under the 2018 Plan will be based on the achievement by NVIDIA of the Performance Goals.  Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant must remain an employee through the payment date under the 2018 Plan to be eligible to earn an award.

      "Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.: On November 29, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of NVIDIA Corporation ( “NVIDIA”) amended and restated NVIDIA’s Bylaws (the “RestatedBylaws”) to implement proxy access and amend certain provisions providing for advance notice of stockholder proposals and nominations for director (other than proposals properly made in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The Restated Bylaws became effective immediately upon adoption by the Board as described below. A new Section 5(h) permits a stockholder (or a group of up to 20 stockholders) owning at least 3% of the voting power of NVIDIA’s outstanding capital stock, continuously for at least three years, to include director nominees in NVIDIA’s annual meeting proxy materials;providedthat the stockholders and nominees satisfy the requirements specified in the Restated Bylaws. These nominees may constitute the greater of two directors or 20% of the Board. Commencing with the annual meeting in calendar 2018, the Restated Bylaws also require a stockholder who desires to nominate a member of the Board for election at NVIDIA’s annual meeting (other than through proxy access) to provide written notice to the Secretary of NVIDIA at least 90 days and no more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders. Under the bylaws that were in effect prior to this amendment, the notice period for stockholder nominations to the Board was between the 120thand 150thday prior to the first anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders. The Restated Bylaws further provide that, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to, or delayed by more than 30 days after, the anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting, or if no annual meeting was held in the prior year, for notice by the stockholder to be timely, such stockholder’s written notice must be delivered to the Secretary between the 90thand 120thday prior to such annual meeting, or not later than the 10thday following public announcement of the date of the meeting by NVIDIA. The Restated Bylaws also include other changes to the provisions in Section 5 to account for proxy access, and a number of other administrative and conforming changes. This description is only a summary of the changes made to the Restated Bylaws and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Restated Bylaws, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.\n",
